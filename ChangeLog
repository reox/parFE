*15-Jun-2009* Tar-file Package is updated to the svn version. ParFE Version 0.2
              includes a multigrid preconditioners.

*14-Nov-2006* Added a test directory to compare matrix-free and matrix-ready
              preconditioners. A newer version of pfaim.cpp, names
              new_pfaim.cpp, is a shorter and easier-to-understand driver
              that can be used for further developments.

*05-Nov-2006* Added a few missing files, and supported matrix-free and
              matrix-ready preconditioners in pfaim.cpp.

*25-Oct-2006* first public version of ParFE. Version 0.1 does not contain
              any multigrid solver yet; the linear system matrix can be solved
              using Jacobi preconditioners.
